# Craps Test 2025

This repository contains a minimal craps simulator used for early development.

## CLI Usage

Run `node src/play.js [n]` to simulate `n` rounds (default 10). The CLI now
rotates the shooter between eight NPC seats.

Run `npm test` to run a basic unit test.

## Browser Demo

Open `index.html` in a browser to play a very simple front-end version with
shooter rotation displayed.
